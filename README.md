# Universal Blue Devcontainer

This repo builds devcontainers for use with Universal Blue projects

## Base
This can be used to build any Universal Blue Image. It will configure some VSCode Extensions for you; however, it is necessary to extend the container if you want to use a different IDE.

## Titanoboa
This devcontainer contains the RPMs necessary for building a Titanoboa ISO. Remember that in order to build Titanoboa you need to have real root priviliges.
